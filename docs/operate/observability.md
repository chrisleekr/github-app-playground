# Observability

Structured JSON logs via [pino](https://getpino.io) are the primary signal. Every dispatch decision and every pipeline step carries a `deliveryId` so you can reconstruct a request end-to-end from a single log query, and the webhook event handlers plus the daemon workflow executor additionally carry a canonical `entityNumber` (the issue or PR number) so a request can be reconstructed by entity as well. When `DATABASE_URL` is configured, the same information is persisted to `executions` and `triage_results` for aggregate reporting.

## Log redaction

The exported `logger` in `src/logger.ts` is the canonical chokepoint for secret scrubbing, every child logger inherits its `redact.paths` list and its custom `err` serializer, so individual call sites do not need to remember to scrub. Two layers run on every emitted line:

1. **Path-based redaction**: the exported `REDACT_PATHS` constant in `src/logger.ts` lists every field pino should replace with `[Redacted]` before the JSON is serialised. Paths covered: `authorization` and its `*.authorization` / `headers.authorization` / `*.headers.authorization` / `req.headers.authorization` / `request.headers.authorization` variants; the webhook signature header `x-hub-signature-256` (also wildcard-prefixed); `response.data.token`; and the named credential fields `token`, `installationToken`, `privateKey`, `webhookSecret`, `anthropicApiKey`, `claudeCodeOauthToken`, `daemonAuthToken`, `awsSecretAccessKey`, `awsSessionToken`, `awsBearerTokenBedrock`, `*.password`. The list is `Object.freeze`d so an accidental `push` from another module cannot silently weaken the policy.

2. **`errSerializer` scrubbing**: the exported `errSerializer` in `src/logger.ts` defers to pino's `stdSerializers.err` and then runs the result's `message`, `stack`, `request.headers`, and `response.data` through `redactGitHubTokens` (`src/utils/sanitize.ts`) plus an inline credential-URL scrubber that mirrors `redactValkeyUrl` (`src/orchestrator/valkey.ts`). The walker recurses through nested objects/arrays and replaces any key matching the sensitive-field-name set wholesale, so `err.response.data.meta.token` and `err.request.headers.forwarded.authorization` are caught at any depth: this is necessary because pino's path-based rules cannot match four-or-more segments deep on `err.*`. It also catches `ghs_…` installation tokens and App JWTs echoed inside `err.message` / `err.stack`.

The serializer operates on a copy, so the original Error instance is never mutated.

If you add a new secret-bearing config field to `src/config.ts`, add its property name to `REDACT_PATHS` in the same PR. The point helpers `redactGitHubTokens` and `redactValkeyUrl` remain in place for their non-log call sites (prompt sanitisation and the Valkey startup info log respectively); the logger config is the system-wide default.

The crash path is covered too. `installFatalHandlers(processName)` in `src/logger.ts` registers `uncaughtException` and `unhandledRejection` handlers at both entrypoints (`src/app.ts`, `src/daemon/main.ts`) that log via `logger.fatal({ err })` and then `process.exit(1)`. Without them the runtime's default handler would print a plain `stderr` stack that bypasses `errSerializer`, so a token echoed inside an octokit error would reach the log shipper in cleartext. The default destination flushes synchronously on the process `exit` event, so the fatal line is written before exit; `pino.final` is intentionally not used because it throws when the logger is built with the dev-only `pino-pretty` transport. Crash lines carry `level: 60` (fatal) and a `processName` of `orchestrator` or `daemon`, so an alert on sustained `level:60` flags a crash-looping process.

Emitted by `createChildLogger` (`src/logger.ts`) across the webhook event handlers and the workflow executor so a request is greppable by entity. Two adjacent layers keep their own names: the job-payload schema uses `prNumber` / `issueNumber`, and the scoped-rail executors use snake_case `pr_number` / `issue_number`.                              |

| `max_attempts`                       | Maximum-attempts ceiling for the current `retryWithBackoff` call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `elapsed_ms`                         | Wall-clock since `retryWithBackoff` entry on a `retry.*` event (integer ms). On `retry.exhausted` it carries the full retry-window duration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Present on `retry.non_retriable` (always, since the branch only fires for 4xx) and on `retry.attempt_failed` when the failure carried one (e.g. 503, 429); also on `github.api.*` events.                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Core pipeline log fields

`runPipeline` (`src/core/pipeline.ts`) emits structured timing events whose `pipeline.stage` shape is pinned by the `.strict()` Zod schema in `src/core/log-fields.ts` (parallel to the ship schema below; the co-located test rejects field drift). Four event keys:

| `event`              | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pipeline.started`   | Request entered `runPipeline`. Carries the child-logger bindings (deliveryId, entity).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `pipeline.stage`     | One stage finished; carries `stage` + `delta_ms`. Stages: trackingComment.create, token.resolve, github.fetch, prompt.build, repo.clone, executor.invoke, trackingComment.finalize, workspace.cleanup.                                                                                                                                                              |
| `pipeline.completed` | Success terminal line; carries `pipeline_wall_clock_ms` alongside `costUsd` / `numTurns` and the token counters `inputTokens` / `outputTokens` / `cacheReadInputTokens` / `cacheCreationInputTokens` (issue #192). Pinned by `PipelineCompletedLogSchema`.                                                                                                          |
| `pipeline.failed`    | Failure terminal line; carries `pipeline_wall_clock_ms` + the redacted `err`, plus `failed_stage` (the timed stage in flight when the throw happened) and `failed_stage_delta_ms` (that stage's wall-clock up to the throw) when a stage was running (issue #226). Both stage fields are omitted if no timed stage was active. Pinned by `PipelineFailedLogSchema`. |

### Token usage and the cache hit-ratio

The executor's `Claude Agent SDK execution completed` line (`src/core/executor.ts`) and the `pipeline.completed` line carry the SDK token counters; the executor line additionally carries a `modelUsage` array (one `{ model, inputTokens, outputTokens, cacheReadInputTokens, cacheCreationInputTokens, costUsd }` entry per model). The same four scalar counters are persisted to the `executions` table (`input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_read_input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`) plus a `model_usage` JSONB column (migration `016_executions_tokens.sql`), so per-installation / per-workflow / per-day aggregates can join them.

Cost alone is opaque: a 500 KB-prompt / 2-turn run and a 5 KB-prompt / 50-turn run can bill the same `costUsd`. Tokens disambiguate them, an oversized prompt is an `inputTokens` problem; a runaway tool-loop is an `outputTokens` + `numTurns` problem. The load-bearing metric for prompt-cache stability (#134) is the hit-ratio:

```
cache_read_input_tokens / (input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens)
```

(The ratio is undefined when the denominator is zero, e.g. a dry-run that never called the model; guard against that in the query.) A high ratio on the second+ run of the same prompt shape confirms `PROMPT_CACHE_LAYOUT=cacheable` is working; a sudden drop in the per-installation cache-read share is the signature of a prompt-cache stability regression. Alert on `sum(cache_read_input_tokens) / sum(input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens)` falling below its established baseline.

### Workspace sweep

`sweepStaleWorkspaces` (`src/core/workspace-sweep.ts`) emits one line per startup sweep when the daemon and the webhook server reclaim stale per-job workspace triples under `CLONE_BASE_DIR` (orphans left by SIGKILL/OOM/eviction). A `swept` count climbing across restarts means jobs are being killed mid-run before their own cleanup runs.

| `event`           | Level | Fields                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `workspace.sweep` | info  | `swept` (entries removed), `retained` (entries kept as fresh), `durationMs` (wall-clock time for the sweep). |

### Agent hook denials

The `PreToolUse` destructive-Bash hook (`src/core/hooks/forbidden-bash.ts`) emits one line each time it blocks a Bash command matching the shared `FORBIDDEN` set (force-push, `git reset --hard`, branch delete, history rewrite, `gh pr merge`, GraphQL merge mutations). A sustained `agent.hook.denied` rate means the agent is repeatedly attempting destructive operations, worth investigating as a possible prompt-injection signal. The raw command is never logged (token-leak risk); only the matched rule label is.

| `event`             | Level | Fields                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent.hook.denied` | warn  | `tool` (always `Bash`), `rule` (the matched FORBIDDEN description, e.g. `git push --force`). |

## GitHub API rate-limit fields

The `App` is constructed with `ObservableOctokit` (`src/utils/octokit-observability.ts`), an `Octokit.plugin` subclass shared by `app.octokit` and every installation octokit. It logs GitHub's per-installation rate-limit headers via `octokit.hook.after` / `hook.error`. The `pipeline.stage`-style strict Zod schema (`GithubApiLogFieldsSchema`) pins the field shape.

Volume policy: the per-request line is `debug` (default `info` stays quiet on a fleet issuing thousands of calls/hour); a `warn` fires only when quota runs low or a rate-limit error lands. Set `LOG_LEVEL=debug` for full per-call visibility, no separate sampling knob.

| `event`                         | Level | Fields                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `github.api.request`            | debug | `route`, `status`, `rate_limit_limit`, `rate_limit_remaining`, `rate_limit_reset_in_s`, `rate_limit_resource` |
| `github.api.rate_limit_low`     | warn  | Same fields; emitted once `rate_limit_remaining` drops below `RATE_LIMIT_LOW_WATER` (500).                    |
| `github.api.rate_limit_warning` | warn  | `route`, `status`, `retry_after_s`; on a 429 or 403 secondary-rate-limit response.                            |

## Retry log fields

`retryWithBackoff` (`src/utils/retry.ts`) is the single chokepoint guarding every transient-failure recovery in the bot, including the GraphQL fetcher, every GitHub-touching MCP server, the orchestrator triage probe, the ship probe, and the pipeline's three GitHub writes. Its four-event family is pinned by a `z.discriminatedUnion` of strict objects in `src/utils/retry-log-fields.ts` so an emitter that adds an unpinned field, mistypes one (e.g. `delayMs` vs `delay_ms`), or attaches a field to the wrong event (e.g. `delay_ms` on `retry.exhausted`, `status` on `retry.succeeded_after_retry`) trips the co-located test. Every event carries `op` (a short dotted identifier from the call site), `attempt`, `max_attempts`, and `elapsed_ms`. See [Common log fields](#common-log-fields) for the scalar field definitions.

**`op` naming convention.** Lowercase-dotted segments with `snake_case` inside each segment, e.g. `mcp.inline_comment.fetch_pr`, `github.state.pr_state_check_rollup`, `tracking_comment.create`. This matches the `pipeline.stage` event-name style already used elsewhere in this doc and keeps `op =~ "mcp\\..*"`-style operator groupings regular as new call sites are threaded. New `retryWithBackoff` call sites should follow it. Empty / whitespace-only `op` is normalised to `"unknown"` at the entry of `retryWithBackoff` so the non-empty `op` contract holds even when a caller threads an unexpected value.

The load-bearing event is `retry.succeeded_after_retry`: it is the only signal in the bot's telemetry today that an upstream is starting to wobble _before_ full failure. A 1% transient-failure rate against GitHub or Bedrock is invisible at the default `info` level otherwise, the only retry telemetry is warn/error, which fires only on the long tail. The `info`-level `succeeded_after_retry` line makes the body of the transient-failure distribution observable; an alert on `count(event = "retry.succeeded_after_retry") by op` over 5-minute windows surfaces the leading indicator without waiting for the warn-level `attempt_failed` count to spike.

| `event`                       | Level | When                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `retry.attempt_failed`        | warn  | An attempt threw a retriable error (5xx, 429, or 403 secondary rate-limit). Carries `delay_ms` when another attempt will follow (omitted on the final attempt) and `status` when the underlying error carried one (HTTP errors; absent for non-HTTP errors like connection resets). |
| `retry.non_retriable`         | warn  | A 4xx (except 429 and 403 secondary rate-limit) bypasses retry. Always carries `status` (the branch only fires when the raw error carried a 4xx) and rethrows.                                                                                                                      |
| `retry.exhausted`             | error | All `max_attempts` attempts failed. Carries the full retry-window `elapsed_ms`; rethrows the last error. Neither `delay_ms` nor `status` are emitted on this event.                                                                                                                 |
| `retry.succeeded_after_retry` | info  | The call succeeded on `attempt > 1`. Weak-flake leading indicator: gated on `attempt > 1` so first-try successes stay silent. Alert on `count(...) by op` over 5-minute windows. Neither `delay_ms` nor `status` are emitted on this event.                                         |

## Idempotency log fields

`claimDelivery` (`src/webhook/idempotency.ts`) is the webhook dedup chokepoint: a Valkey `SET key 1 NX EX` claim that returns `true` exactly once per `deliveryId` **only on the healthy Valkey path** within GitHub's 3-day redelivery window. When Valkey is unavailable or errors it fails **open**, returning `true` for every delivery (including redeliveries), so the exactly-once guarantee degrades to at-least-once. Its three-event family is pinned by a union of strict objects in `src/webhook/idempotency-log-fields.ts` so an emitter that mistypes an event name, drops `reason` from a fail-open line, or attaches `err` to the `unavailable` path trips the co-located test. Every event carries `deliveryId` (camelCase, the established child-logger delivery identifier binding). Behaviour is fail-open: `idempotency.claimed` and `idempotency.failed_open` both proceed with processing; only `idempotency.duplicate_skipped` skips.

| `event`                         | Level | Fields                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `idempotency.claimed`           | debug | `deliveryId`. The SET-NX won the claim (first time this delivery is seen); the caller proceeds. At `debug` because it fires once per non-duplicate delivery, too loud at `info` for a busy installation.                 |
| `idempotency.duplicate_skipped` | info  | `deliveryId`. The SET-NX found an existing key (a redelivery); the caller skips.                                                                                                                                         |
| `idempotency.failed_open`       | warn  | `deliveryId`, `reason` (`unavailable` when Valkey is unconfigured/disconnected, `error` when the SET threw), and `err` (the error message, on the `error` branch only). The caller proceeds (at-least-once degradation). |

## Output secret-guard log events

`safePostToGitHub` (`src/utils/github-output-guard.ts`) is the output-side chokepoint for every byte sent to GitHub. It emits structured `warn`/`error` events when the regex pass or the optional LLM scanner acts on a body. Per the logging contract, none of these carry the matched bytes, surrounding context, or a hash, only `kinds`, counts, lengths, `callsite`, and `deliveryId`.

| `event`                             | Level | When                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## MCP server log fields

The stdio MCP servers (`src/mcp/servers/*.ts`) run as subprocesses without the daemon `config`, so they cannot import `src/logger.ts` (it reads `config` at module load). Instead they build a pino logger via `createMcpLogger(serverName)` (`src/mcp/mcp-logger.ts`), which writes to **stderr** (stdout carries JSON-RPC) and applies the same `REDACT_PATHS` + `errSerializer` as the main logger, imported from the config-free `src/utils/log-redaction.ts` so redaction has parity without pulling in `config`. This replaced the prior raw `console.error` calls, where a `console.error(err)` on an Octokit `RequestError` could dump a `ghs_…` token verbatim.

| Field        | Meaning                                                                                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `server`     | MCP server name (e.g. `github-comment`, `github-state`, `merge-readiness`).                     |
| `deliveryId` | Inherited from the parent request via the `DELIVERY_ID` env (set in `registry.ts` `sharedEnv`). |
| `event`      | Structured event key, e.g. `secret_redacted` when the output secret-guard strips bytes.         |

`LOG_LEVEL` is in the executor subprocess env allowlist, so `LOG_LEVEL=debug` on the daemon propagates to the CLI and the MCP subprocesses for incident response.

## Fleet snapshot fields

The orchestrator emits a periodic `fleet.snapshot` info line (`src/orchestrator/fleet-snapshot.ts`, cadence `FLEET_SNAPSHOT_INTERVAL_MS`, default 30s) so backlog and pool saturation stay log-visible even when no webhook is arriving to trigger an on-demand read. Set `FLEET_SNAPSHOT_INTERVAL_MS=0` to disable.

| Field                   | Meaning                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `queue_depth`           | `LLEN queue:jobs`, the shared job queue backlog.                          |
| `active_daemons_total`  | Number of live daemons in the `active_daemons` set.                       |
| `busy_slots_total`      | Sum of in-flight jobs across the live daemons.                            |
| `persistent_free_slots` | Spare capacity (`maxConcurrentJobs - active`) across the persistent pool. |

Alerts worth having: `queue_depth` rising while `persistent_free_slots > 0` for several snapshots (suggests broken capability matching, work isn't reaching idle daemons); `active_daemons_total` dropping to 0 while `queue_depth > 0` (no workers).

## Dispatcher log fields

The job dispatcher (`src/orchestrator/job-dispatcher.ts`) and the accept handler in `src/orchestrator/connection-handler.ts` emit the offer lifecycle as structured events. The four `dispatcher.offer.*` keys are pinned per-event by a `z.discriminatedUnion` (`src/orchestrator/log-fields.ts:75#DispatcherOfferLogSchema`), so each event carries exactly its own fields; `dispatcher.no_eligible_daemon` has its own shape. Event-key constants live in `src/orchestrator/log-fields.ts:28#DISPATCHER_LOG_EVENTS`, and the co-located test rejects field drift.

| `event`                         | Level | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dispatcher.offer.sent`         | info  | An offer was sent to a selected daemon. Carries `kind`, `deliveryId`, `daemonId`, `offerId`, plus `fleetSize` + `requiredTools` for capacity/capability diagnostics, plus `queue_wait_ms` (enqueue→offer wait for this attempt; see the per-attempt note below).                                                                                      |
| `dispatcher.offer.accepted`     | info  | The daemon claimed the offer. Carries `deliveryId`, `daemonId`, `offerId` plus `offer_latency_ms`, the offer→accept WebSocket round-trip, measured the instant the accept arrives so it excludes the orchestrator-side context lookup + token mint. `kind` is omitted here; correlate to the `sent` line by `offerId` for the authoritative job kind. |
| `dispatcher.offer.rejected`     | info  | The daemon refused the offer; carries `reason` + `offer_latency_ms`. The job is re-queued for another daemon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `dispatcher.offer.timed_out`    | warn  | No accept or reject arrived within `OFFER_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 5s); carries `offer_latency_ms` (≈ the timeout). The job is re-queued.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `dispatcher.no_eligible_daemon` | info  | No live daemon matched the job's `requiredTools` or had free capacity. Carries `fleetSize` + `requiredTools` so an operator can separate a capability-match miss from sheer capacity exhaustion, plus `queue_wait_ms` (wait at the moment of the miss), which surfaces a capability-match bounce loop that the `queue_depth` gauge hides.             |

`offer_latency_ms` and `queue_wait_ms` are the snake_case fields, matching the `delta_ms` metric idiom; ids stay camelCase, consistent with the app-wide pino correlation fields.

`queue_wait_ms` is `max(0, Date.now() - job.enqueuedAt)` at the moment of the event. **It is per-attempt, not end-to-end:** `enqueuedAt` is reset to `Date.now()` on every requeue (the `requeueJob` paths in `src/orchestrator/job-queue.ts` and the `reconstructJobFromOffer` paths in `src/orchestrator/job-dispatcher.ts`), so a job that bounces through `no_eligible_daemon` or a daemon reject restarts the clock. Read it as "how long this attempt waited for a dispatch decision," the saturation signal (USE-method "time waiting" / Sidekiq queue latency), not total time in system. Alert: a sustained p99 `queue_wait_ms` over ~30s on `dispatcher.offer.sent` indicates fleet undersizing; cross-check against `offer_latency_ms` (rising there instead points to slow daemons, not too few of them).

## Daemon heartbeat fields

The orchestrator pings each connected daemon every `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` (default 30s) and evicts one that misses pongs past `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 90s). The heartbeat lifecycle in `src/orchestrator/connection-handler.ts` emits three structured events pinned per-event by a `z.discriminatedUnion` (`src/orchestrator/log-fields.ts:142#DaemonHeartbeatLogSchema`), so `missedPongs` is pinned to `pong_missed` and `ttl_refresh_failed` carries its `err`; constants live in `src/orchestrator/log-fields.ts:36#DAEMON_HEARTBEAT_LOG_EVENTS`.

| `event`                               | Level | Meaning                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `daemon.heartbeat.pong_missed`        | warn  | A ping was sent while the prior pong was still outstanding; carries the running `missedPongs` count. |
| `daemon.heartbeat.timeout`            | warn  | The pong window elapsed; the connection is closed and the daemon eligible for re-registration.       |
| `daemon.heartbeat.ttl_refresh_failed` | error | A pong arrived but refreshing the daemon's Valkey/Postgres TTL failed; carries the redacted `err`.   |

Alerts worth having: a sustained `daemon.heartbeat.timeout` rate points at network or resource-floor issues (a flapping daemon), distinct from a daemon that is responding slowly (visible as rising p99 `offer_latency_ms`).

## Ship workflow log fields

The shepherding lifecycle emits structured pino lines validated against the canonical Zod schema in `src/workflows/ship/log-fields.ts`. Field names and types are pinned so emitters cannot drift.

| Field                       | Type                                                                            | When present                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `event`                     | string (e.g. `ship.intent.transition`, `ship.probe.run`, `ship.reactor.fanout`) | Always.                                                                                       |
| `intent_id`                 | UUID                                                                            | Always.                                                                                       |
| `pr`                        | `{owner, repo, number, installation_id}`                                        | Always.                                                                                       |

| `trigger_surface`           | `literal` \| `nl` \| `label`                                                    | Session-start events only.                                                                    |

| `wall_clock_ms`             | non-negative integer                                                            | Always, cumulative session wall-clock.                                                        |

The schema is the source of truth. Adding or renaming a field requires updating `src/workflows/ship/log-fields.ts`; the co-located test round-trips a sample through the schema and rejects unknown / mistyped fields.

### Iteration / tickle / scoped event keys

Every shepherding emitter draws its `event` value from the typed `SHIP_LOG_EVENTS` constant in `src/workflows/ship/log-fields.ts`. Operators can grep for these literals deterministically.

| Event key                             | Where it fires                                                                    | What it indicates                                                                             |

| `ship.iteration.terminal_cap`         | `iteration.runIteration` cap check                                                | The intent hit `MAX_SHIP_ITERATIONS`.                                                         |
| `ship.iteration.terminal_deadline`    | `iteration.runIteration` deadline check                                           | The intent's `deadline_at` elapsed.                                                           |
| `ship.tickle.started`                 | `app.ts` boot, after `tickleScheduler.start()`                                    | The cron tickle scheduler is scanning `ship:tickle`.                                          |
| `ship.tickle.due`                     | `orchestrator.onStepComplete` early-wake **or** `session-runner.resumeShipIntent` | An intent is being re-entered. `source` discriminates `workflow_run_completion` vs scheduler. |
| `ship.tickle.skip_terminal`           | `orchestrator.onStepComplete` early-wake                                          | The hook found a `shipIntentId` but the intent is already terminal; the ZADD was skipped.     |
| `ship.scoped.<verb>.enqueued`         | `dispatch-scoped.ts` after `enqueueJob`                                           | A scoped command (`rebase`, `fix_thread`, `explain_thread`, `open_pr`) was enqueued.          |
| `ship.scoped.<verb>.daemon.completed` | `connection-handler.handleScopedJobCompletion` and the executor                   | Daemon reported `succeeded`.                                                                  |
| `ship.scoped.<verb>.daemon.failed`    | Same                                                                              | Daemon reported `halted` or `failed`. `reason` carries the structured halt reason.            |

## Dispatch reasons

Canonical source: `src/shared/dispatch-types.ts`. Four values; all land on `dispatch_target=daemon`.

| Reason                      | When the router sets it                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `persistent-daemon`         | Routed to an existing persistent daemon. The default, hot path. Also used during cooldown when a scale-up was warranted but blocked by the cooldown window. |
| `ephemeral-daemon-triage`   | Triage returned `heavy=true` and an ephemeral daemon Pod was spawned.                                                                                       |
| `ephemeral-daemon-overflow` | Queue length ≥ `EPHEMERAL_DAEMON_SPAWN_QUEUE_THRESHOLD` **and** the persistent pool has zero free slots; a spawn drains the overflow.                       |
| `ephemeral-spawn-failed`    | A spawn was required but the K8s API call failed. The job is rejected with a tracking-comment infra error.                                                  |

## Scheduled action log fields

Emitted by the scheduler (`src/scheduler/`, component `scheduler`) and the
daemon executor.

| Event                               | Meaning                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scheduler.action.claimed`          | A due cron slot was claimed and a `scheduled-action` job enqueued.      |
| `scheduler.action.skipped_missed`   | A slot fired while the server was down; advanced over, not run.         |
| `scheduler.action.daemon.started`   | The daemon began running a scheduled action.                            |
| `scheduler.action.daemon.completed` | The action's agent session finished (`success`, `costUsd`, `numTurns`). |
| `scheduler.action.daemon.failed`    | The action failed before the agent ran (e.g. repo lookup).              |

The scheduler logs action metadata (`name`, `cron`, `owner`, `repo`,
`deliveryId`) only, never the resolved prompt text.

## Structured-output log fields

The `parseStructuredResponse` chokepoint (`src/ai/structured-output.ts#parseStructuredResponse`) emits one `structured_output.*` event per call when a caller passes `{ site, log }`. The field contract is pinned by `StructuredOutputLogFieldsSchema` (`src/ai/structured-output-log-fields.ts#StructuredOutputLogFieldsSchema`). `site` is the call-site discriminator; a rising `strategy: "tolerant"` share per site is the leading indicator of a model JSON-quality regression. `raw_len` is the model output length (never the bytes); `error` is redacted via `redactErrorMessage`.

| Event                               | Level | Fields                                                                                     |

| `structured_output.parse_failed`    | warn  | `site`, `raw_len`, `parse_ms`, `error`                                                     |
| `structured_output.validate_failed` | warn  | `site`, `raw_len`, `parse_ms`, `error`, `parsed_kind` (`object` \| `array` \| `primitive`) |

Wired sites (`site` value): `triage-orchestrator`, `intent-classifier`, `chat-thread`, `discussion-digest`, `nl-classifier`, `triage-handler`, `llm-output-scanner`. (`meta-issue-classifier` is a pure function with no logger in scope and omits the context.)

## Triage circuit breaker events

The triage circuit breaker caps the blast radius of a Claude/Bedrock outage. It emits a structured `circuit.*` event family in addition to the existing `triage circuit breaker transition` line. The schema is pinned by `circuit-breaker-log-fields.ts#CircuitLogFieldsSchema`; emit wiring lives in `triage.ts` on the shared breaker's `onEvent` hook. `deliveryId` appears on the paired caller-side short-circuit / fallback lines via the per-request child logger.

| Event               | Level | Fields                                                                | Meaning                                                                                              |

| `circuit.opened`    | warn  | `from`, `consecutive_failures`, `latency_tripped`                     | Breaker tripped to open. `latency_tripped:true` is a slow-call trip; `false` is a thrown-error trip. |
| `circuit.half_open` | info  | `from`                                                                | Cooldown elapsed; the next call is admitted as the half-open probe.                                  |
| `circuit.closed`    | info  | `open_ms`                                                             | A probe succeeded and the breaker recovered. `open_ms` is trip→recovery wall-clock (MTTR).           |
| `circuit.skipped`   | warn  | `open_ms`, `skips_since_opened`                                       | A request was short-circuited while open. `skips_since_opened` resets on each trip.                  |
| `circuit.failure`   | warn  | `consecutive_failures`, `max_consecutive_failures`, `latency_tripped` | A failure recorded but the breaker did not trip.                                                     |

## Discussion digest log fields

`src/workflows/discussion-digest.ts#buildDiscussionDigest` runs on the forced prefix of every comment-aware workflow (`triage`, `plan`, `implement`, `review`, `resolve`, `remember`) and issues ≥1 LLM call per event against `config.digestModel`. The `digest.*` family makes that call observable: skip rate, per-call token spend and latency, and the owner-directive trust-boundary outcome. Field shapes are pinned by `src/workflows/digest-log-fields.ts#DigestLogFieldsSchema`. No comment content is ever logged (counts, lengths, durations, and bounded enums only).

| `event`                 | Level | Fields                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `digest.skipped`        | info  | `comment_counts` `{ owner, other, bot }`                                                                                                               |
| `digest.call.completed` | info  | `phase` (`extract` \| `reduce`), `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `latency_ms`, `strategy` (`strict` \| `tolerant`)                                    |
| `digest.completed`      | info  | `chunks`, `total_latency_ms`, `directives_kept`, `directives_dropped`, `has_prior_bot_output`, `untrusted_context_count`, `conversation_summary_chars` |
| `digest.failed`         | warn  | `reason` (`no-comments` \| `llm-error` \| `parse-error`)                                                                                               |

`directives_dropped > 0` means `enforceOwnerDirectives` discarded a directive attributed to a non-owner-block author (the signature of a prompt-injection or model-regression event the trust boundary exists to catch).

## GitHub API latency

Every octokit request is timed across the `hook.wrap` boundary in `octokit-observability.ts#installRateLimitHooks`. The measured wall-clock duration is threaded as `duration_ms` onto every `github.api.*` line (`github.api.request`, `github.api.rate_limit_low`, `github.api.rate_limit_warning`), so per-route p50/p95/p99 GitHub-side latency is queryable at `LOG_LEVEL=debug`. When a request's `duration_ms` reaches `GITHUB_API_SLOW_REQUEST_MS` (default `3000`), a separate `warn` line fires regardless of log level:

| Event             | Level | Fields                           |
| ----------------- | ----- | -------------------------------- |
| `github.api.slow` | warn  | `route`, `status`, `duration_ms` |

The slow line is independent of rate-limit headers, so a slow response from an endpoint with no `x-ratelimit-*` headers still surfaces. This is the GitHub-side counterpart to the dispatcher's `offer_latency_ms`. Tune the floor with `GITHUB_API_SLOW_REQUEST_MS` (`config.ts#githubApiSlowRequestMs`).

## GitHub App installation-token mints

The orchestrator mints App installation tokens at six call sites, all routed through `mintInstallationToken` (`src/orchestrator/installation-token.ts#mintInstallationToken`). Each mint emits one structured line. Schema pinned by `GithubAppTokenMintLogSchema` (`src/orchestrator/log-fields.ts#GithubAppTokenMintLogSchema`). `cache_hit` is exact, not a latency heuristic: `@octokit/auth-app` serves cached tokens synchronously and only issues `POST /app/installations/{id}/access_tokens` on a miss.

| Event                             | Level | Fields                                               | Meaning                                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `github.app.token.mint.succeeded` | info  | `installation_id`, `via`, `cache_hit`, `duration_ms` | A token was returned (cache when `cache_hit:true`, else fresh mint).                   |
| `github.app.token.mint.failed`    | warn  | `installation_id`, `via`, `duration_ms`, `err`       | The mint threw; `duration_ms` distinguishes a fast failure from a GitHub-edge timeout. |

`via` is one of `handleAccept`, `handleScopedAccept`, `postOrphanNotification`, `shipTickleResume`, `proposalPoller`, `schedulerRunAction`. The token, App JWT, and private key are never logged (security invariant 2); `err` is serialized through the secret-scrubbing pino error serializer.

## Inbound HTTP boundary

Structured access-log family for the webhook server's inbound HTTP surface (webhook entry, HMAC verification failure, readiness probe, operator scheduler endpoint). Schema pinned in `src/app-log-fields.ts#HttpLogFieldsSchema`; emit sites in `src/app.ts`. All lines carry bounded metadata only, never the webhook secret, the `X-Hub-Signature-256` bytes, the raw request body, or `Authorization` headers.

| Event                                  | Level | Fields                                      | Meaning                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `http.webhook.received`                | info  | `deliveryId`, `event_name`, `duration_ms`   | A delivery entered the webhook middleware (header values, not body).                                |
| `http.webhook.error`                   | warn  | `kind`, `deliveryId?`, `event_name?`, `err` | `kind: "signature_mismatch"` (HMAC failure), `"handler_threw"`, or `"other"`. Fact of failure only. |
| `http.readyz.unready`                  | info  | `is_ready`, `valkey_healthy`                | `/readyz` returned 503. `/healthz` is intentionally silent.                                         |
| `http.scheduler.run.rejected_disabled` | warn  | `status` (404)                              | Scheduler disabled.                                                                                 |
| `http.scheduler.run.rejected_unauth`   | warn  | `status` (401)                              | Bad operator bearer token (never logged).                                                           |
| `http.scheduler.run.rejected_payload`  | warn  | `status` (413 \| 400), `reason`             | `body_too_large`, `invalid_json`, `not_object`, `missing_field`.                                    |
| `http.scheduler.run.enqueued`          | info  | `status` (202 \| 409), `enqueued`           | `enqueued:true` → 202 fresh; `false` → 409 dedup.                                                   |
| `http.scheduler.run.failed`            | error | `status` (500), `err`                       | Operator endpoint threw; `err` secret-scrubbed.                                                     |

The `kind` discriminator on `http.webhook.error` separates signature-verification failures (botched webhook-secret rotation) from downstream handler exceptions.

## Scheduler scan lifecycle events

The scheduled-actions scheduler (`src/scheduler/scheduler.ts#createScheduler`) emits a `scheduler.scan.*` lifecycle on every timer tick. These are scan-level signals (heartbeat, duration, traffic, saturation), orthogonal to the per-action `scheduler.action.*` transitions. Schema pinned in `src/scheduler/log-fields.ts#SCHEDULER_LOG_EVENTS`. Scheduler lines carry no `deliveryId` (the scan is timer-driven, not request-scoped).

| Event                            | Level | Fields                                                                                                          | Meaning                                                              |

| `scheduler.scan.completed`       | info  | `duration_ms`, `repos_enumerated`, `actions_evaluated`, `actions_claimed`, `actions_advanced`, `actions_failed` | A scan finished cleanly.                                             |
| `scheduler.scan.skipped_overlap` | warn  | `since_started_ms`                                                                                              | A tick fired while the previous scan was still running (saturation). |
| `scheduler.scan.failed`          | error | `duration_ms`, `err`                                                                                            | The scan tick threw.                                                 |

## Workflow run lifecycle events

Structured lifecycle events for `workflow_runs` state transitions, emitted at the transition call sites (the `runs-store` mutators stay log-free because they are reused under transactions). Pinned by `src/workflows/log-fields.ts#WorkflowRunLogFieldsSchema`. Common fields: `runId`, `workflowName`, `target` (`{ type, owner, repo, number }`), and `deliveryId` (omitted for system-spawned runs). Terminal events add `duration_ms`.

| `event`                         | Level        | Extra fields                | Meaning                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `workflow.run.running`          | info         | _none_                      | Daemon flipped the row to `running`.                                                        |
| `workflow.run.succeeded`        | info         | `duration_ms`               | Terminal success.                                                                           |
| `workflow.run.incomplete`       | warn         | `duration_ms`, `reason`     | Agent ran cleanly but a handler gate left work outstanding.                                 |
| `workflow.run.failed`           | warn / error | `duration_ms`, `reason`     | Terminal failure. `warn` for handler-reported, `error` for uncaught throw.                  |
| `workflow.run.handed_off`       | info         | `duration_ms`, `childRunId` | Composite parent handed off to a child; row stays `running`.                                |
| `workflow.run.dispatch_refused` | info         | `reason` (no `runId`)       | Refused before any row inserted.                                                            |
| `workflow.run.enqueue_failed`   | error        | `reason`                    | Post-insert enqueue/publish failed; compensating `markFailed` released the in-flight guard. |

## Workspace lifecycle events

The `workspace.*` family makes the non-success workspace-cleanup paths greppable, complementing the success-path `pipeline.stage stage=workspace.cleanup` row and the startup `workspace.sweep` reaper. Schema pinned by `WorkspaceLogFieldsSchema` (`src/core/workspace-events.ts#WorkspaceLogFieldsSchema`). `workDir` is a process-local temp path and safe to log; the authenticated clone URL embeds the install token and is never logged (clone events carry the `owner/repo` slug and branch only). All `err` fields routed through `redactErrorMessage`.

| Event                                | Level | Fields                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `workspace.clone.started`            | info  | `repo`, `branch`, `depth`                                       |
| `workspace.clone.completed`          | info  | `repo`, `branch`, `clone_ms`                                    |
| `workspace.clone.failed`             | warn  | `repo`, `branch`, `err`                                         |
| `workspace.base_branch.fetched`      | info  | `baseBranch`, `headBranch`                                      |
| `workspace.base_branch.fetch_failed` | warn  | `baseBranch`, `headBranch`, `err`                               |
| `workspace.cleanup.completed`        | info  | `workDir`                                                       |
| `workspace.cleanup.failed`           | warn  | `workDir`, `target` (`clone` \| `helper` \| `artifacts`), `err` |
| `workspace.cleanup.exit`             | warn  | `count`, `jobIds`                                               |
| `workspace.cleanup.cancel`           | info  | `workDir`                                                       |

`workspace.cleanup.exit` is one line per daemon exit with in-flight workspaces: a non-zero `count` is a crashloop fingerprint.

## Agent tool-call events

The executor's Agent SDK message loop emits one structured event per tool call, pairing the SDK's `assistant` `tool_use` block with its later `user` `tool_result` block by the Anthropic-protocol `tool_use_id`. Emitted by `executeAgent` in `src/core/executor.ts#executeAgent`; schemas pinned in `src/core/log-fields.ts#CORE_AGENT_LOG_EVENTS`.

| Event                  | Level | Fields                                                | When                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent.tool.started`   | info  | `tool_use_id`, `tool`                                 | A `tool_use` block appears in an assistant message.                              |
| `agent.tool.completed` | info  | `tool_use_id`, `tool`, `tool_duration_ms`, `is_error` | The paired `tool_result` arrives.                                                |
| `agent.tool.timed_out` | warn  | `tool_use_id`, `tool`, `delta_ms`                     | The run terminates with a `tool_use` still unpaired (wall-clock abort mid-call). |

All three carry only bounded metadata. Tool **input** (e.g. a Bash command) and **output** (a result body) are deliberately never logged: both can carry secrets or attacker-injected text. These events share the per-request child-logger bindings (`deliveryId`, `owner`, `repo`, `entityNumber`).

## Daemon connection events

The daemon's outbound WebSocket client (`src/daemon/ws-client.ts#DaemonWsClient`) emits one structured pino line per connection-lifecycle transition, pinned by `src/daemon/log-fields.ts#DaemonConnectionLogSchema`. Daemon-side companion to the orchestrator-side `daemon.heartbeat.*` events.

| `event`                                 | Level | Fields                                          | When                                                             |
| --------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `daemon.connection.connect_attempt`     | info  | `attempt`, `downtime_ms`, `previous_backoff_ms` | A `connect()` call is starting. `attempt` is 1 on first connect. |
| `daemon.connection.connected`           | info  | `attempt`, `time_to_connect_ms`, `downtime_ms`  | `onopen` fired. `attempt` resets to 0 after this line.           |
| `daemon.connection.disconnected`        | info  | `code`, `reason`, `connected_duration_ms`       | `onclose` fired. `code`/`reason` are the close frame.            |
| `daemon.connection.reconnect_scheduled` | warn  | `attempt`, `backoff_ms`                         | Backoff timer armed; `attempt` is the upcoming attempt.          |
| `daemon.connection.error`               | error | `readyState`, `message?`                        | `onerror` fired or `connect()` threw. `message` scrubbed.        |

Per security invariant 2 the `DAEMON_AUTH_TOKEN`, `Authorization` header, and orchestrator URL never appear; `message` is scrubbed via `redactErrorMessage`.

## K8s spawn log fields

The ephemeral-daemon spawn lifecycle (the orchestrator's only horizontal-scaling vector) emits a `k8s.spawn.*` structured event family. Schema pinned by `K8sSpawnLogFieldsSchema` (`src/orchestrator/k8s-spawn-log-fields.ts#K8sSpawnLogFieldsSchema`). Only bounded metadata is logged: never a K8s service-account token, kubeconfig contents, or the Pod env.

| Event                        | Level                                   | Fields                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `k8s.spawn.decision_skipped` | debug (`no-signal`) / info (`cooldown`) | `delivery_id`, `reason` (`no-signal` \| `cooldown`), `heavy`, `queue_length`, `persistent_free_slots` |
| `k8s.spawn.attempted`        | info                                    | `delivery_id`, `trigger` (`triage-heavy` \| `queue-overflow`)                                         |
| `k8s.spawn.succeeded`        | info                                    | `delivery_id`, `trigger`, `pod_name`, `namespace`, `api_call_ms`                                      |
| `k8s.spawn.failed`           | error                                   | `delivery_id`, `kind`, `trigger?`, `api_call_ms?`                                                     |

`api_call_ms` is the `createNamespacedPod` round-trip wall-clock; present on `succeeded` and on `api-rejected`/`api-unavailable` failures, absent on `infra-absent`/`auth-load-failed` (which throw before any K8s call). `kind` (`EphemeralSpawnErrorKind`): `infra-absent`, `auth-load-failed`, `api-rejected` (4xx), `api-unavailable` (5xx/network). These events add the by-kind and by-latency breakdown that the `dispatch_reason=ephemeral-spawn-failed` aggregate lacks.

## Aggregate reporting

When `DATABASE_URL` is set, helpers in `src/db/queries/dispatch-stats.ts` expose the most operator-relevant aggregates:

| Helper                           | Returns                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `eventsPerTarget(days)`          | Count of executions grouped by `dispatch_target`. Post-collapse this is always a single `daemon` row, query `dispatch_reason` directly for the per-reason split. |
| `triageRate(days)`               | Share of events whose `dispatch_reason` is `ephemeral-daemon-triage`.                                                                                            |
| `avgConfidenceAndFallback(days)` | Mean triage confidence plus fallback counts by reason.                                                                                                           |
| `triageSpend(days)`              | Cumulative `cost_usd` for triage-reached executions.                                                                                                             |

Call them from an internal admin endpoint, a scheduled job, or `bun repl`.

## Alerts worth having

- **Triage error rate.** `parse-error` + `llm-error` + `timeout` + `circuit-open` above a sustained threshold (e.g. 10 % over 15 minutes) signals provider trouble or a regression.
- **Ephemeral spawn failures.** Any `dispatch_reason=ephemeral-spawn-failed` points at RBAC, quota, or control-plane issues.
- **Heartbeat drift.** Daemons missing heartbeats past `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MS` get evicted; sustained eviction points at network or resource-floor issues. A `daemon.heartbeat.timeout` rate above baseline is the log-side signal.
- **Daemons refusing work.** A sustained `event:"dispatcher.offer.rejected"` rate (group by `reason`) means daemons are bouncing offers, a capacity or capability mismatch, before the queue visibly backs up.
- **Offer round-trip latency.** A p99 regression on `offer_latency_ms` for `event:"dispatcher.offer.accepted"` flags a daemon that is responding but slow (GC pause, capability rescan stall, WebSocket back-pressure), eating dispatch headroom without tripping the heartbeat timeout.
- **OOM / crash loops.** Standard infra alerts. Durable idempotency means a restart will not replay a processed event.
- **Ship terminal-blocker rate.** A spike in `ship.intent.transition` events with `to_status:human_took_over` and `terminal_blocker_category:flake-cap` points at PR-flake regressions, not bot misbehaviour.
- **Circuit breaker trips.** Alert on `event:"circuit.failure" AND consecutive_failures >= 3` for a pre-trip head start; facet `circuit.opened` by `latency_tripped` (`true` ⇒ raise timeouts, `false` ⇒ page on-call); chart `open_ms` from `circuit.closed` for MTTR.
- **Model JSON-quality regression.** A rising `count(event="structured_output.parsed" AND strategy="tolerant") / count(event="structured_output.parsed") by site`, or any `event:"digest.failed" AND reason:"parse-error"`, signals the model is drifting from the strict JSON contract.
- **Digest trust-boundary drops.** `event:"digest.completed" AND directives_dropped > 0` is the signature of a prompt-injection or model regression the owner-directive boundary caught; steady state is zero.
- **GitHub API latency.** A `github.api.slow` rate above baseline (or a `duration_ms` p99 regression) tells you the bottleneck is GitHub-side, not the daemon.
- **Token-mint cache misses.** A drop in `github.app.token.mint.succeeded` `cache_hit:true` rate means a regression is bypassing the cached App singleton and paying a network mint per dispatch.
- **Webhook signature failures.** Any sustained `event:"http.webhook.error" AND kind:"signature_mismatch"` rate is a botched `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` rotation dropping deliveries.
- **Scheduler saturation.** A gap in `scheduler.scan.started` longer than the scan interval means the timer stalled; any `scheduler.scan.skipped_overlap` over a 5m window means scans are saturating the interval (precursor to drifting cron slots).
- **Workflow enqueue failures.** Any `event:"workflow.run.enqueue_failed"` means a row was inserted but never reached a daemon; the compensating `markFailed` ran, but a sustained rate points at a broker outage.
- **Daemon reconnect storms.** `event:"daemon.connection.reconnect_scheduled" AND attempt >= 5` flags a daemon stuck in backoff.
- **Workspace crashloop fingerprint.** A non-zero `count` on `event:"workspace.cleanup.exit"` means a daemon exited with in-flight workspaces.
- **Ephemeral-spawn failures by kind.** Break `dispatch_reason=ephemeral-spawn-failed` down with `event:"k8s.spawn.failed"` `kind`: `infra-absent` (deploy regression), `api-rejected` (RBAC/validation), `api-unavailable` (control-plane). A sustained `k8s.spawn.decision_skipped reason:"cooldown"` rate means the fleet is under-scaled.

## Data fetching safety caps

`src/core/fetcher.ts` walks every `pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }` connection it receives via `octokit.graphql.paginate(...)`, so PRs/issues with hundreds of comments, reviews, inline review comments, or changed files are no longer silently truncated to the first 100. The four `MAX_FETCHED_*` env vars (see [`configuration.md`](configuration.md)) bound the **merged result** that reaches the agent prompt, they do not bound how much data is fetched and held in memory during pagination. The fetcher walks every page first, then trims the array to the most recent `cap` items; fetch-time memory is bounded by GitHub API limits (max items per connection), not these caps. Operators tuning for cost/latency should narrow entity selection (e.g. close noisy issues) rather than rely on the cap to cut request volume.

When a cap fires the fetcher emits a single structured warn line per affected connection and flags the connection on the returned `FetchedData` so downstream code can surface it:

```json
{
  "level": "warn",
  "msg": "Fetched comments exceeded MAX_FETCHED cap; truncating to 500",
  "connection": "comments",
  "fetched": 642,
  "cap": 500
}
```

`connection` is one of `comments`, `reviews`, `reviewComments`, `changedFiles`. The matching boolean lands on `FetchedData.truncated.<connection>` (`src/types.ts`).

`buildPrompt` (`src/core/prompt-builder.ts`) reads `data.truncated` and, when at least one flag is set, prepends a `WARNING: pre-fetched context is incomplete…` line to the agent's instructions naming the affected connections and instructing it to reach for the GitHub CLI / API directly when full context matters. Operators reading agent transcripts can grep for that banner to confirm a cap fired without re-querying logs.

Alert rule: any `level=warn msg~"exceeded MAX_FETCHED cap"` occurrence is interesting. A steady stream from the same `repo` over several deliveries usually means the cap should be raised for that tenant; a one-off on a notoriously huge PR is expected and not actionable.

| `/readyz`  | Readiness, 200 once config is validated and the data layer is reachable; flips to 503 on `SIGTERM`. |

## Supply-chain attestations

> Note: As SBOM file size is over 16MB, temporary disable SBOM attestations.

`docker-build.yml` publishes two attestation flavours per release tag, same image, different storage and verification surface. Operators investigating a CVE alert or auditing what shipped to production reach for these instead of re-running Trivy from scratch.

Docker Hub renders a "Build attestations" badge on the tag page once the Sigstore-signed flavour is detected. The full source/predicate of every signature is replayable via the [Sigstore transparency log (Rekor)](https://search.sigstore.dev/) using the digest from `gh attestation verify`.

The `scan` job in `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` calls `gh attestation verify` for both predicate types before running Trivy: a regression-gate against silent attestation drops in any future refactor of the build / merge jobs. Consumer-side verification commands live in [`deployment.md`](deployment.md#verifying-image-attestations).
