# GitHub App Playground

A GitHub App that responds to `@chrisleekr-bot` mentions on pull requests and issues, powered by the Claude Agent SDK. Every webhook is acknowledged in under ten seconds and handed to the daemon fleet over WebSocket; when triage flags the job as heavy or the queue backs up, the orchestrator spawns an ephemeral daemon Pod on Kubernetes so the same image scales on demand.
