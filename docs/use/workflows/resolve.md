## Method

For each open reviewer comment the agent classifies as **Valid**, **Partially Valid**, **Invalid**, or **Needs Clarification**, then:

- Fixes valid ones with new commits.
- Replies to all four classes appropriately, in the same three-block layout (status line, bold one-line title, prose reasoning).
- Marks the thread resolved (Valid / Partially Valid only) via the `resolve-review-thread` MCP tool after the reply lands.
- Fixes failing CI when there is a clear root cause.
- Polls CI after the final commit and does not exit until all checks return to green (or the per-iteration `FIX_ATTEMPTS_CAP=3` is exhausted, in which case the unresolved failure is recorded under `## Outstanding` in `RESOLVE.md`).

Branch refresh happens first if the head is stale (same logic as `review`).

Reviewer-thread replies are posted via `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<num>/comments/<id>/replies -X POST`. The bot's `gh` and `git` calls authenticate via `GH_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN`, injected from the GitHub App installation token by `buildProviderEnv` in `src/core/executor.ts`.

### Reply body format

All four classifications use the same shape so bot replies look consistent across `resolve`, `review`, `bot:fix-thread`, and `bot:chat-thread` (the conversational executor that subsumed the former `bot:explain-thread`):

```markdown
<STATUS_LINE>

**<One-line title summarizing what was done or concluded.>**

<1–3 sentences of reasoning: why the fix was applied, why the reviewer was right/wrong, or what specifically needs clarifying. Cite file:line where relevant. No diff: the commit link covers that.>
```

| Classification      | Status line                                  | Resolves thread?     |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Valid               | `_✅ Addressed_, commit \`<sha>\``           | Yes                  |
| Partially Valid     | `_⚠️ Partially addressed_, commit \`<sha>\`` | Yes                  |
| Invalid             | `_❌ Not applicable_`                        | No (reviewer closes) |
| Needs Clarification | `_❓ Need clarification_`                    | No                   |

## Post-pipeline CI re-check (issue #93)

The handler does **not** trust the agent's self-report. After `runPipeline()` returns successfully, it:

1. Re-fetches the PR's head SHA (the agent may have pushed commits).
2. Paginates `checks.listForRef` against that SHA.
3. Applies the canonical "all-green" definition, failing iff `status === "completed"` AND `conclusion ∈ {failure, cancelled, timed_out, action_required}`. `skipped`, `neutral`, and `success` are acceptable.
4. Parses the `## Outstanding` section out of `RESOLVE.md`.
5. Returns `succeeded` only when **both** signals are clean (CI all-green AND `## Outstanding` empty/absent). Otherwise returns the new `incomplete` terminal status with `humanMessage` carrying the outstanding content.

The shared definition lives in `src/workflows/handlers/checks.ts` so the prologue snapshot and the post-pipeline re-check can never drift.

### `incomplete` terminal status

`incomplete` is a fourth `HandlerResult` variant ("agent ran cleanly but work remains") distinct from `succeeded` / `failed` / `handed-off`:

- The DB `workflow_runs.status` column accepts `incomplete` (migration `009_workflow_runs_incomplete.sql`).
- `runs-store.markIncomplete(runId, reason, state)` mirrors `markFailed`, persisting `state.incompleteReason`.
- The daemon executor (`src/daemon/workflow-executor.ts`) reacts `confused` on the trigger comment, mirrors the handler's `humanMessage`, sends `job:result` with `success: false` and an `incomplete:`-prefixed `errorMessage`.
- The orchestrator cascade keeps its binary `succeeded | failed` contract: the executor maps `incomplete` → `failed` for cascade purposes, but the parent's tracking-comment headline reads "ship halted at step N (... → resolve), resolve returned incomplete; see PR tracking comment for outstanding items." instead of the generic failure message.

## Stop conditions

- `FIX_ATTEMPTS_CAP = 3`: maximum consecutive CI-fix attempts per run.
- `POLL_WAIT_SECS_CAP = 900` (15 min): reviewer-patience window before the run terminates.
- The handler **never** calls `octokit.rest.pulls.merge`: merging is a human action.

## Failure handling

Public-comment and operator surfaces are separated so a raw SDK or octokit error never reaches the public PR thread. Both the `runPipeline` failure path and the outer handler `catch` apply the same separation:

- **Public tracking comment**: a safe constant: `"resolve pipeline execution failed, see server logs for details."` The actual error string remains internal because octokit error stacks include `https://x-access-token:GHS_xxx@…` in the request URL.
- **Operator surfaces**: `state.failedReason` on the `workflow_runs` row, `pino` log lines on the daemon, and `ExecutionResult.errorMessage` returned to the orchestrator. The orchestrator's transient-quota detector reads `state.failedReason` and auto-defers the ship loop's next iteration when the SDK reports `"You've hit your limit · resets … UTC"`.
