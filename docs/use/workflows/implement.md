## PR detection

`findRecentOpenedPr` filter is auth-mode aware (`src/workflows/handlers/implement.ts`):

- **App installation token (default)** — matches `pr.user?.type === 'Bot'` plus `created_at >= since - 5s`. Deliberately not keyed on a slug because dev installs publish as `chrisleekr-bot-dev[bot]` and prod as `chrisleekr-bot[bot]`.
- **`GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` mode** — a PAT authors PRs as the human owner (`type === 'User'`), so the bot-type filter would skip them. The handler resolves the active token's login via `octokit.rest.users.getAuthenticated()` and matches `pr.user?.login === <PAT owner>`. If `/user` fails (transient), the handler logs warn and falls back to the bot-type filter — worst case is the same false negative we had before this fix, never a wrong-PR claim.

## PR body

The agent reads `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/bot-implement.md` and fills every section based on actual work, then passes it via `gh pr create --body-file …`. This keeps bot PRs structurally consistent and prevents `gh` from auto-falling back to the human PR template.

## Stop conditions

- Pipeline pushes a branch and opens a PR.
- Pipeline succeeds but `findRecentOpenedPr` returns null → handler fails with `"implement completed but no PR was found"`.
- Pipeline fails → handler reports the underlying error.

The handler does **not** poll CI or reviewer state — that is `resolve`'s job, after `review` has run.

## Failure handling

The handler treats public and operator surfaces separately so the public tracking comment never carries the raw underlying error. Both the `runPipeline` failure path and the outer handler `catch` set the same safe `humanMessage`:

- **Public tracking comment** — a safe constant: `"implement pipeline execution failed — see server logs for details."` Octokit error stacks embed the installation token in the request URL, so the bot must never inline `err.message` into a comment body.
- **Operator surfaces (DB + logs)** — the SDK error is propagated as `ExecutionResult.errorMessage` and persisted as `state.failedReason` on the `workflow_runs` row. `pino` logs the full `err` object on the daemon. The orchestrator's quota-detection helper reads `state.failedReason` to decide whether to auto-defer the next ship iteration; see [`ship.md`](./ship.md).
