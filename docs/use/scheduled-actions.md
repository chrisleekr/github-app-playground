# Scheduled actions

The bot can run **prompt-based actions on a cron schedule**, unattended, in
addition to reacting to `@chrisleekr-bot` mentions and `bot:*` labels.

A GitHub App receives no native cron event, so the bot runs its own internal
scheduler inside the webhook server. Each scan it enumerates installed repos,
reads a `.github-app.yaml` from each, and enqueues any action whose cron slot
is due. The daemon fleet runs each action as a single agent session.

## Enabling

Scheduled actions run only when the operator has set:

- `SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true`
- `DATABASE_URL` configured
- a non-empty `ALLOWED_OWNERS` (the action prompt is owner-trusted config, so
  the feature refuses to start without an owner allowlist)

See [Configuration](../operate/configuration.md#scheduled-actions).

## `.github-app.yaml`

Place the file at your repo's **default-branch root**.

```yaml
version: 1

config:
  timezone: "Australia/Melbourne" # IANA tz for cron evaluation; default "UTC"

scheduled_actions:
  - name: research # unique per file; [a-z0-9-], 1-64 chars
    cron: "0 3 * * *" # standard 5-field cron, evaluated in config.timezone
    timezone: "UTC" # optional per-action override of config.timezone
    enabled: true
    model: "opus" # optional; defaults to the bot's CLAUDE_MODEL
    max_turns: 200 # optional; agent turn cap, 1-500
    timeout: 60m # optional; wall-clock ceiling (ms or Nh/Nm/Ns)
    auto_merge: false # see "Auto-merge" below
    allowed_tools: # optional; defaults to a read-only set
      - WebSearch
      - WebFetch
      - Read
      - "Bash(gh issue create:*)"
    prompt:
      ref: ".github/skills/research.md"
```

A malformed file fails validation and the whole repo is skipped for that scan
(logged); a valid file never partially applies.

## Prompt forms

`prompt` is exactly one of:

| Form   | YAML                                              | Behaviour                                                                     |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| inline | `prompt: { inline: "..." }`                       | The text is the prompt verbatim.                                              |
| file   | `prompt: { ref: "path/to/file.md" }`              | The file's contents are the prompt.                                           |
| folder | `prompt: { ref: "dir/", entrypoint: "SKILL.md" }` | Entrypoint + one level of sibling files, concatenated with `=== FILE: … ===`. |

Add `repo: "owner/name"` to a `ref` to source the prompt from another repo
owned by the **same owner** as the action's repo (see [Trust model](#trust-model)).

## How a run executes

The scheduler is dumb: it only fires the prompt. The agent does all the work
the prompt describes, pick an issue, triage, label, open a PR, etc., as one
agent session, with the action's `model`, `max_turns`, `timeout`, and
`allowed_tools`. It is a separate execution path from the `bot:ship` workflow.

- **Missed slots are skipped.** If the server is down across a cron slot, that
  slot is dropped (the next slot still fires): a daily action down for three
  days runs once, not three times.
- **Single-flight.** A new run is skipped while the action's previous run is
  still in-flight (the lock self-heals after a stale window).
- **Multi-replica safe.** A compare-and-swap slot claim means replicas never
  double-fire.

## Auto-merge

When an action sets `auto_merge: true` **and** the operator has set
`SCHEDULER_ALLOW_AUTO_MERGE=true`, the daemon exposes a `merge_readiness` MCP
tool (`check_merge_readiness`). It wraps the deterministic merge-readiness
verdict used by `bot:ship` (CI green, no conflicts, no open review threads, no
human takeover). The skill prompt is expected to call it and merge only when
the verdict is `ready` **and** the agent is confident.

`merge_readiness` only _reports_ readiness: it does not merge. For the agent
to actually merge, the action's `allowed_tools` must additionally include a
merge-capable tool (e.g. `"Bash(gh pr merge:*)"`).

**The two switches gate the `merge_readiness` tool, not merging itself.**
`allowed_tools` is owner-trusted config: an action granted a merge-capable
Bash tool can merge even with `SCHEDULER_ALLOW_AUTO_MERGE=false`: it just
loses the deterministic readiness check. The switches exist so the
bot-provided readiness tool is offered only to runs the operator has opted
in; they are not a sandbox. If you must prevent any unattended merge, do not
grant a merge-capable tool in `allowed_tools`.

Both switches default off. The verdict bounds _mergeability_, not
_correctness_: a scheduled action that merges still trusts the LLM's judgement
on whether the change is right.

## Trust model

`.github-app.yaml`, the prompt, and `allowed_tools` are editable by anyone with
push access to the repo, so they are treated as **trusted-as-owner config**,
the same trust tier as a `.github/workflows/` file. The owner-allowlist gate is
load-bearing: scheduled actions run only for `ALLOWED_OWNERS` repos.

A cross-repo prompt `ref` (`repo: "owner/name"`) must name a repo owned by the
**same owner** as the action's repo: the run holds one installation token,
scoped to a single account, so a cross-owner ref is a different installation
the token cannot read and is rejected. Within that owner, a contributor with
push access to repo A can source a prompt from any other repo the owner
controls that the installation can read; keep prompt sources within trust you
already extend to that owner.

## Manual trigger

Operators can force one action to run immediately, bypassing the cron check:

```
curl -X POST https://<bot-host>/api/scheduler/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DAEMON_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"owner":"chrisleekr","repo":"github-app-playground","action":"research"}'
```

Returns `202` when enqueued, `409` when a run is already in-flight, `404` when
the scheduler is disabled, `401` on a bad token.

## The `research` action

This repo ships a `research` action: the in-App replacement for the
`.github/workflows/research.yml` GitHub Actions workflow. The skill prompt is
`.github/skills/research.md`; a copyable example is under
`examples/scheduled-actions/`. It runs at 19:00 UTC, a fixed **2 hours after**
`research.yml`'s 17:00 UTC slot (both in UTC, so daylight saving never shrinks
the gap), so while both are live they never overlap. The cutover is to verify
the action in production, then delete `research.yml`.
