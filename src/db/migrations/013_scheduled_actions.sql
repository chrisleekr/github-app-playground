-- Migration 013: scheduled_action_state — per-action scheduling state for
-- the scheduled-actions feature (`.github-app.yaml` → internal cron).
--
-- One row per (installation_id, owner, repo, action_name). The scheduler
-- (src/scheduler/) reads `last_run_at` to decide whether a cron slot is due,
-- and writes it back via a compare-and-swap UPDATE so two webhook-server
-- replicas ticking at the same time cannot enqueue the same slot twice.
--
-- `in_flight_job_id` + `in_flight_started_at` are the single-flight /
-- concurrency lock, mirroring research.yml's `concurrency:
-- cancel-in-progress: false` (skip, never overlap). The claim UPDATE
-- refuses to fire while a run is in-flight UNLESS the lock is stale
-- (`in_flight_started_at` older than a generous window). Staleness makes
-- the lock self-healing: a daemon that dies mid-run cannot strand the
-- action, and no completion hook is needed to release it. The cron
-- cadence is always far longer than the stale window, so a fast run
-- holding the lock until the window elapses is harmless in practice.
--
-- Per-run history is NOT stored here; it reuses the existing `executions`
-- table, same as every other daemon job.
