/**
 * FR-014 operator aggregate queries for the triage-dispatch-modes feature.
 *
 * Thin typed wrappers over `Bun.sql` for the four queries defined in
 * `specs/20260415-000159-triage-dispatch-modes/contracts/dispatch-telemetry.md`
 * §5. Operator dashboards and ad-hoc reports read through this module so
 * the SQL stays in one place — any future schema migration only needs to
 * update the queries here.
 *
 * All queries accept a `days` window (default 30) and use parameterised
 * intervals (`NOW() - make_interval(days => $1)`) so the caller-provided
 * value cannot build into a SQL-injection surface. The backing indexes
 * (`idx_executions_dispatch_target_created_at`,
 * `idx_triage_results_created_at`) from migration 003 keep each query in
 * the low-millisecond range at expected data volumes.
 *
 * Each function also accepts an optional `sql` override that defaults to
 * the `requireDb()` singleton. Tests pass a dedicated connection so they
 * don't have to mutate `process.env.DATABASE_URL` (which wouldn't take
 * effect anyway once `config` is captured at first import).
