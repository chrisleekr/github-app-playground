/**
 * Canonical pino log-field schema for ephemeral-daemon spawn observability (issue #234).
 *
 * Mirrors `src/utils/retry-log-fields.ts`: a `.strict()` Zod discriminated union
 * pins the structured `k8s.spawn.*` event family so the emit sites across the
 * scaler (`decideEphemeralSpawn`), the spawner (`spawnEphemeralDaemon`), and the
 * router cannot drift on a field name (e.g. `apiCallMs` vs `api_call_ms`) without
 * the co-located test catching it. Emitters log plain objects via `log.debug` /
 * `log.info` / `log.error`; the schema is the drift-prevention contract, not a
 * runtime validator on the hot path.
 *
 * The schema is a `z.discriminatedUnion` on `event` so per-event field presence
 * is pinned: `decision_skipped` carries the decision-time signals; `attempted`
 * carries only the trigger; `succeeded` carries `pod_name` + `namespace` +
 * `api_call_ms`; `failed` carries `kind` and an *optional* `api_call_ms` (the
 * `infra-absent` / `auth-load-failed` kinds throw before the K8s round-trip, so
 * no API latency exists to report).
 *
 * SECURITY: only bounded metadata is logged, never a K8s service-account token,
 * kubeconfig contents, or the Pod's env. Error free-text is redacted via
 * `redactErrorMessage` (`src/utils/log-redaction.ts`) at the emit site and pino's
 * `err` serializer; this schema does not enumerate `err`.
 *
 * `api_call_ms` is the wall-clock of the single `createNamespacedPod` round-trip
 * (snake_case, forward-compatible with OpenTelemetry duration conventions).
 * `delivery_id` correlates a spawn decision to the webhook delivery that drove it.
