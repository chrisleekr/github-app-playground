/**
 * Canonical pino log-field schema for the `workflow_runs` lifecycle (issue #235).
 *
 * Mirrors `src/core/log-fields.ts` and `src/webhook/idempotency-log-fields.ts`:
 * a strict Zod shape pins the structured `workflow.run.*` event family so the
 * emit sites at every state transition cannot drift on a field name (e.g.
 * `durationMs` vs `duration_ms`, or a target shape change) without the
 * co-located test catching it. Emitters log plain objects via `log.info` /
 * `log.warn` / `log.error`; the schema is the drift-prevention contract, not a
 * runtime validator on the hot path.
 *
 * The mutators in `src/workflows/runs-store.ts` stay log-free (they have no
 * logger and are reused under transactions in `orchestrator.ts` /
 * `ship/iteration.ts`), so the events are emitted at the callers, the same
 * convention as `scheduler.action.claimed`. The existing `reason:` / `outcome:`
 * fields on the legacy log lines are left in place; this adds the `event:`
 * discriminator alongside them.
 *
 * `runId`, `workflowName`, `target`, and `deliveryId` are the established
 * camelCase child-logger bindings reused repo-wide; new metric-style fields
 * (`duration_ms`) are snake_case. `deliveryId` is optional because system-spawned
 * runs (ship iteration, orchestrator cascade children) have no originating
 * webhook delivery. `duration_ms` is carried only on terminal events that own a
 * start timestamp (the daemon executor's `startedAt`).
