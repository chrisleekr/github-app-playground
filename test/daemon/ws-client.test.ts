/**
 * Regression test for src/daemon/ws-client.ts.
 *
 * Covers: the reconnect timer is scheduled ref'd (keeps the event loop
 * alive across backoff) and is cleared by close(). Prior to the fix, the
 * timer was .unref()'d, which caused the daemon process to exit silently
 * on the first disconnect instead of reconnecting.
